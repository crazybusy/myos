; This is the kernel's entry point. We could either call main here,
; or we can use this to setup the stack or other nice stuff, like
; perhaps setting up the GDT and segments. Please note that interrupts
; are disabled at this point: More on interrupts later!

; This part MUST be 4byte aligned, so we solve that issue using 'ALIGN 4'

    ; Multiboot macros to make a few lines later more readable

    MULTIBOOT_MEMORY_INFO	equ 1<<1

; This will set up our new segment registers. We need to do

; Here is the definition of our BSS section. Right now, we'll use
; it just to store the stack. Remember that a stack actually grows
; downwards, so we declare the size of the data before declaring
; the identifier '_sys_stack'
